make sure to remove the previous files before placing other ones there;

put everything in the nixos folder into the /etc/nixos folder;

then run **sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ".#(your username here!!!!)"**;

also change the user "awoeeq" everywhere where it is mentioned with your username in the flake.nix file

use the "waypaper" app to set your wallpaper, hyprland will recall what you selected there every reboot

to have the same fetch icon as me, put "fastfetch.png" into your /home/**your username**/Pictures folder, thats where fastfetch looks for it
